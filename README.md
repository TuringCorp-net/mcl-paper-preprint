## Abstract (short)
We present a Meta-Coordination Layer (MCL) that transfers human organizational practices to multi-agent collaboration, improving output quality on complex, open-ended tasks. MCL encodes workflows as a task graph G=(V, E) with role contracts and deliberation-to-convergence checks. In two comparative studies, MCL was preferred by ~80% (academia, n=14) and ~90% (business, n=45) over strong single-model baselines, with absolute score gains of about +0.5 and +0.9. Collaboration increases cost (5–10x tokens, 2–10x latency), making MCL best for quality-first scenarios.
